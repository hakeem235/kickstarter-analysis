# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

    The massively successful crowdfunding service Kickstarter has raised over $2 billion, but not all projects succeed. Of his over 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only one-third have made it through the funding process with positive results.

    To be funded on Kickstarter, your project must meet or exceed its original goals. As a result, many organizations spend months sifting through past projects to find the secret to success. This project organized and analyzed a database of 4,000 past projects, using conditional formatting and pivot tables to uncover hidden trends.
