# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

    The massively successful crowdfunding service Kickstarter has raised over $2 billion, but not all projects succeed. Of his over 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only one-third have made it through the funding process with positive results.

    To be funded on Kickstarter, your project must meet or exceed its original goals. As a result, many organizations spend months sifting through past projects to find the secret to success. This project organized and analyzed a database of 4,000 past projects, using conditional formatting and pivot tables to uncover hidden trends.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

   - In May, there is more than a 100% success rate.
    - In October, there is a 50% field rate.
    - April, where there is more than a 60% success rate.
    - The worst month to start a campaign is December, where there is a less than 40% success rate.

    _________

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

    - The data sourced from multiple countries, and their currency, in this case, I don't get how the data normalized those currencies into one and compared the outcome.
    - The data is not normally distributed we need more samples to generalize about the data set.

    ____
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    - Make outlier testing
    - Creating a table and graph by excluding outliers
    - Creating a graph that shows the campaign result quarterly, and yearly
    - Conducting some statistical analysis, creating a table and graph that shows the difference in campaign outcomes across categories and time
    - Creating a graph and table by making a comparison across different countries on the campaign being successful or failed.
    - Creating a comparison table or graph which shows average donation across campaign outcomegn
